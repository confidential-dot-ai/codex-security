 * chain against the bundled AMD roots, VEK validity period, VEK chip-id/TCB
 * cross-validation against the report) plus VMPL and debug policy. When
 * `minTcbJson` is supplied, a reported TCB below the floor fails closed. When

 * freshness are verified and the VEK is checked against it — the result's
 * `collateral_verified` reports whether that ran.

 * verified in WASM, debug TDs are rejected, and — when the evidence carries a
 * `cc_eventlog` — the CCEL is replayed against RTMR0–3, failing closed on any
 * divergence. Unlike the vTPM platforms, the freshness anchor
 * (`expectedReportData`) is checked directly against the TD quote's 64-byte
 * `report_data` (zero-padded, constant-time). The measurement surfaces as

 * async provider and are skipped in WASM: `collateral_verified` stays `false`.

 * RTMR[3] to equal it, and **throws** on a mismatch. RTMR[3] is extended after
 * launch (on a c8s node: the operator key bound at boot, plus any per-workload
 * measurements chained on), so unlike MRTD it identifies a specific deployment
 * rather than a build. It is not replayable from the CCEL by construction,
 * which is why it must be supplied rather than derived.
